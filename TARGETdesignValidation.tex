\begin{abstract}

%Interest in urban climate has grown rapidly in the last decade.  
The adverse impacts of urban heat islands and global climate change are leading policy-makers to consider green and blue infrastructure (GBI)  for heat mitigation benefits.  Though many models exist to evaluate the cooling impacts of GBI, their complexity and computational demand leave them largely inaccessible to those  without specialist expertise and computing facilities. Here a new model called \textbf{T}he \textbf{A}ir-temperature \textbf{R}esponse to \textbf{G}reen/blue-infrastructure \textbf{E}valuation \textbf{T}ool (\glssymbol{Toolkit2}) is presented. TARGET is designed to be efficient and easy to use, with fewer user-defined parameters and less model input data required than other urban climate models.  TARGET can be used to model street level air temperature at fine spatial scales (e.g. 30 m), meaning it can be used at the street, precinct, or city scales. The model aims to balance realistic representation of physical processes and computation efficiency.  An evaluation  against two different datasets shows that TARGET can reproduce the magnitude and patterns of both air temperature and surface temperature within suburban environments.  To demonstrate the utility of the model for planners and policy-makers,  the results from two precinct-scale heat mitigation scenarios are presented. TARGET will be made available to the public and ongoing development, including a graphical user interface, is planned for future work.

\section{Introduction}\label{sec:introduction}


%Policy and decision makers  are  increasingly aware of the cooling potential of  green and blue infrastructure. Recent examples of this include the Australian Federal Government's 20 Millon Trees Program and Singapore Green Plan.  Governments and urban planners wish to evaluate the cooling effects of design/planning options. Concurrently, urban climate models are becoming more  complex, allowing more complete representation of  urban physics; however, the complexity of urban climate models renders them inaccessible to consultants, who typically work for designers and planners. Commonly used urban climate models, such as the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model (REF) and Envi-MET (REF) require trained research scientists and significant computational resources to run. As a result, consultants who often work with planners and policy makers usually provide  generic and unsubstantiated estimates of cooling magnitudes. Consequently, there is a need for simple, computationally efficient, and  scientifically-defensible urban climate models that can be used by consultants to provide reliable estimates of cooling to governmental planners and policy-makers.

Policy and decision-makers  are  increasingly aware of the cooling potential of  green and blue infrastructure (GBI). Recent examples of this include the Australian Federal Government's 20 Millon Trees Program \citep{CommonwealthofAustralia2017} and Singapore Green Plan \citep{SMEWR2012}.  Governments and urban planners wish to evaluate the cooling effects of design/planning options. Concurrently, urban climate models are becoming more  complex, allowing more complete representation of  urban physics; however, the complexity of urban climate models renders them inaccessible to consultants \citep{Elasson2000}, who typically work for designers and planners. Commonly used urban climate models, such as the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model 
\citep{Skamarock2008} and ENVI-met \citep{Bruse1999} require trained research scientists and significant computational resources to run. As a result, consultants usually provide generic and unsubstantiated estimates of cooling magnitudes. Consequently, there is a need for simple, computationally efficient, and  scientifically-defensible urban climate models that can be used by consultants to provide reliable estimates of cooling to governmental planners and policy-makers. 

There are a number of existing micro-to-local scale urban models capable of modelling GBI. At the far end of complexity spectrum are models primarly based on computational fluid dynamics (CFD) based techniques. These include ENVI-met, hand-coded  CFD models (such as OpenFOAM \citep{OpenFOAM2011} or STAR-CD \citep{CDadapco2011}), and other CFD based approaches \citep{Bailey2014,Bailey2016,Kunz2000,Schlunzen2011a,Yamada2011,Bruse1999}. ENVI-met is easily the most commonly used urban microclimate model. However, numerous  ENVI-met studies have reported concerns with  model accuracy, particularly for representation of vegetation  \citep{Ali-Toudert2006b,Kruger2011,Acero2015,Spangenberg2008}. In addition, the complexity of configuration and computational intensity of all CFD based models (i.e. 24 hours of simulation requiring 24 hours of computation time) puts their usage well out of the reach of non-specialized users. 

A second group of commonly used models focus around radiation fluxes in urban areas. These models have been used to assess GBI cooling, especially tree shading. However, the limitations of these models may not allow a complete assessment of GBI cooling effects. For example, the SOLWEIG \citep{Lindberg2008a} and RayMan \citep{Matzarakis2007,Matzarakis2010} models can only account for the shading effects of trees, while the effects of evapotranspiration are neglected. Additionally, the Temperatures of Urban Facets in 3D (TUF-3D) model \citep{Krayenhoff2007b} and a vegetated derivative (VTUF-3D) \citep{nice2018}, can be used to assess human thermal comfort. However, TUF-3D and VTUF-3D also require a high level of computer power, modeling experience, and parameter setup.  

The canyon air temperature (CAT) model \citep{Erell2006} shows potential as a computationally efficient model that calculates air temperatures using urban building and vegetation geometry and moisture availability. However, the lack of surface temperature prediction makes it difficult to derive human thermal comfort indexes. The Town Energy Balance (TEB) model \citep{Masson2000} has emerged as a popular urban area parameteristion scheme. The TEB-Veg \citep{Lemonsu2012,redon2017} variation includes  urban vegetation and provides functionality to assess cooling impacts of GBI. However, the TEB-Veg model configuration and application requires a  level of modelling skill outside the capability of environmental  consultants. 

While not an air temperature model, the Local-Scale Urban Meteorological Parameterization Scheme (LUMPS) \citep{Grimmond2002a} has been widely used  to assess the impacts of GBI on surface energy balance (SEB). The Surface Urban Energy and Water Balance Scheme (SUEWS) \citep{Jarvi2011}, a superset of LUMPS adding urban water balance functionality, provides a means to assess vegetation (and associated soil) transpiration impacts at local scales and. SUEWS shows good performance in SEB evaluations for Vancouver and Los Angeles \citep{Jarvi2011}, Helsinki \citep{Jarvi2014a}, and Singapore \citep{demuzere2017impact}. Due to the success and simplicity of the LUMPS model we use it as a key component of this project.  

The lack of an efficient yet accessible tool for assessing GBI has been identified as a research gap. Here we introduce and evaluate a new model called \textbf{T}he \textbf{A}ir-temperature \textbf{R}esponse to \textbf{G}reen/blue-infrastructure \textbf{E}valuation \textbf{T}ool (\glssymbol{Toolkit2}). \glssymbol{Toolkit2} a simple modelling tool that calculates surface temperature and street level (below roof height) air temperature in urban areas. \glssymbol{Toolkit2} is designed to make quick and accurate assessments of urban microclimate and blue/green infrastructure cooling with minimal input data. \glssymbol{Toolkit2} is formulated to be applied at the micro-to-local-scales (street-to-precinct scales); meaning it can be used to assess the cooling benefits of small scale interventions (e.g. a single street or small urban park) to suburb scale greening projects. The computational efficiency of the model is such that a user (with 1--2 hours of training) could calculate in minutes the 30 m horizontal resolution  cooling effects, on a normal desktop computer, across an entire suburb/local-government area or neighbourhood. 

%An efficient, rigorous and easy to use model is required and does not yet exist. This article introduces and evaluates a new model called \textbf{T}he \textbf{A}ir-temperature \textbf{R}esponse to \textbf{G}reen/blue-infrastructure \textbf{E}valuation \textbf{T}ool (\glssymbol{Toolkit2}). \glssymbol{Toolkit2}, a simple modelling tool that calculates surface temperature and street level (below roof height) air temperature in urban areas. \glssymbol{Toolkit2} is designed to make quick and accurate assessments of urban microclimate and blue/green infrastructure cooling with minimal input data. \glssymbol{Toolkit2} is formulated to be applied at the micro-to-local-scales (street-to-precinct scales); meaning it can be used to assess the cooling benefits of small scale interventions (e.g. a single street or small urban park) to suburb scale greening projects. The computational efficiency of the model is such that a user (with 1--2 hours of training) could calculate 30 m horizontal resolution  cooling effects, on normal desktop computer, across an entire suburb/local-government area or neighbourhood in minutes. 

The main aims of this paper are the following: (1) to provide a technical description of TARGET; (2) to provide detailed evaluation of model performances; and (3) to provide proof of concept, and illustrate how the model could be operationalized  by a consultants and practitioners.



\section{Model description}\label{sec:ModelOverview}
\subsection{Model overview}

As outlined in Figure \ref{fig:canyon}, \glssymbol{Toolkit2} treats each model grid point as an idealized urban canyon with roofs, walls, and  ground-level facets.   Roof width (\glssymbol{Wroof}), building  height (\glssymbol{BH}), tree width (\glssymbol{Wtree}),  street width (\glssymbol{W})  are used to define the geometry of the canyon. The thermal and radiative characteristics of roofs and walls are considered to be uniform. At street level, the surfaces  can be defined as: concrete, asphalt, grass, irrigated grass, and water. Trees are represented at roof height and the surfaces beneath trees are considered to be representative of the ground level surfaces. 
%Trees are represented at ground level in \glssymbol{Toolkit2} and  surfaces directly beneath trees are currently not represented in the model, but are approximated as thermally inactive due to the tree shading. 
Additionally, water bodies are treated separately to all other surfaces using an independent  module. More details about the model process is shown in Figure \ref{fig:overview}. For each grid point, the average surface characteristics are used to calculate an aggregated surface temperature (\glssymbol{Tsf}). \glssymbol{Tsf} is converted to an average canopy layer air temperature (\glssymbol{Tac}), using a estimated canopy wind speed (\glssymbol{Ucan}), and above canopy air temperature (\glssymbol{Tb}).  A uniform \glssymbol{Tb} for all grid points is diagnosed for each timestep using reference meteorological variables.

\subsection{Input data requirements}\label{sec:datainputs}
\subsubsection{Land cover}\label{sec:landcover}

\glssymbol{Toolkit2} uses simple data inputs that are intended to be easily accessible.  The model requires the user to define the plan area of buildings (\glssymbol{Abldg}), concrete (\glssymbol{Aconc}), asphalt (\glssymbol{Aasph}), grass (\glssymbol{Agras}), irrigated grass (\glssymbol{Aigrs}), tree (\glssymbol{Atree}), and water (\glssymbol{Awatr}). These land cover categories are self-explanatory and describe most of the surfaces present in urban areas. Local governments often have geographical information system (GIS) datasets of land cover and/or land-use that can be used for land cover input data. Further, we intend to develop a graphical user interface (GUI) that allows users to easily inout land cover datasets and define the model domain. This  feature will allow users to convert and upload GIS data (e.g. shape and raster files) directly into the model. The \glssymbol{Wroof}, \glssymbol{Wtree}, \glssymbol{W}, \glssymbol{W*}, and wall area (\glssymbol{Awall}) are calculated from plan area land cover inputs. However, \glsdesc{BH} must be user defined or set to a domain average value. If detailed land cover data are not available, input data can be defined from existing land-use look-up tables or from databases such as the World Urban Database and Portal Tool (WUDAPT) \citep{mills2015,Ching2018}. See \cite{wouters2016efficient} for an example of how the WUDAPT data could be integrated. 

%The model also requires average building height (\glssymbol{BH}) and street width (\glssymbol{W}) information. The building geometry data are  used to calculate the vertical wall area (\glssymbol{Awall}), see eq. \ref{eq:Awall}.



\subsubsection{Meteorological data}\label{sec:metdata}

\glssymbol{Toolkit2} requires reference meteorological data to drive the model and calculate microscale urban air temperature. The following meteorological variables are required: incoming shortwave (solar) radiation (\glssymbol{kdown}), incoming longwave (terrestrial) radiation (\glssymbol{ldown}), relative humidity (\glssymbol{RH}), reference wind speed (typically at 10 m) (\glssymbol{Uz}), and air temperature (\glssymbol{Ta}). The user must define the height above ground of reference \glssymbol{Uz} and \glssymbol{Ta}. Ideally, meteorological data should be representative of a nearby urban site. However, the nearest airport weather station will suffice. %Australian users should use the nearest Bureau of Meteorology (BoM) airport weather station for reference meteorological data. 
At a minimum, reference meteorological data should conform to World Meteorological Organization guidelines \citep{oke2007siting}.

%To assist model users, it is our intention to generate reference meteorology datasets for each of Australian capital city. These location-specific datasets will include: average summer, average winter, and heatwave conditions


%\subsection{Above canyon conditions}

%The first step in the model process is to calculate the \glssymbol{Tb}, which a uniform value across the whole domain. Reference meteorological data is used.  


\subsection{Radiation calculation}\label{sec:net}




The net radiation of the $ith$ surface type ($R_{n,i}$) is calculated using the following:

\begin{equation} 
R_{n_,i}  = \bigg(\glssymbol{kdown} (1-\glssymbol{albedo}_{i}) + \glssymbol{epsilon}_{i} \big(\glssymbol{ldown} - \glssymbol{sigma} T_{surf,i,[t-2]}^{4}\big) \bigg)\glssymbol{SVF}_{i}
\label{eq:rn2} \end{equation} where \glssymbol{albedo}$_{i}$ is \glsdesc{albedo}, \glssymbol{epsilon}$_{i}$ is \glsdesc{epsilon}, \glssymbol{Ta} is forcing air temperature (K), and \glssymbol{sigma} is the \glsdesc{sigma}. The \glssymbol{albedo}$_{i}$ and \glssymbol{epsilon}$_{i}$ values are predefined for each surface (see Table \ref{tab:Parameter}).  The right hand side of the equation accounts for net longwave radiation. The modelled $T_{surf,i,[t-2]}$ from 2 time steps $(t)$ previously is used to calculate \glssymbol{lup}. This is necessary to avoid circular logic in model calculations; modelled $T_{surf,i,[t-2]}$ is calculated using  the storage heat flux (\glssymbol{DeltaS}), which takes \glssymbol{Rn} from the previous time step.  The time lag does not significantly affect calculations when a 30 minute time step is used. The average sky view factor ($\glssymbol{SVF}_{i}$) is included to broadly represent the  interception of incoming and outgoing short and longwave radiation by buildings and trees on the radiation balance. Addition of \glssymbol{SVF} restricts the net radiation exchange of each facet to its total view factor occupied by sky. It assumes that walls and ground surfaces have similar longwave emission relative to the sky, and that solar radiation receipt can be approximated by \glssymbol{SVF}, on average. This simplification means that the model makes no distinction  between lit and unlit buildings walls.   $\glssymbol{SVF}_{i}$ for ground-level, wall, and roof facets is defined as \citep{Sparrow1978}:

\begin{equation}
SVF_{ground} = \Bigg[1+\bigg(\frac{\glssymbol{BH}}{\glssymbol{W*}}\bigg)^2\Bigg]^\frac{1}{2} - \frac{\glssymbol{BH}}{\glssymbol{W*}} ;
\end{equation} 

\begin{equation}
SVF_{wall} = \frac{1}{2} \Bigg( 1 + \frac{\glssymbol{W*}}{\glssymbol{BH}} - \bigg[ 1 + \bigg(\frac{\glssymbol{W*}}{\glssymbol{BH}}\bigg)^2\bigg]^\frac{1}{2} \Bigg) ;
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
SVF_{roof} = 1
\end{equation} The $R_{n,i}$ is then used to calculate a \glssymbol{DeltaS} for each surface type.

\subsection{Storage heat flux ($Q_{G}$) calculation}\label{sec:lumps}

% Scott's comment: The assumption here, and you state it in the introduction, is that this partitioning can be applied to each surface as opposed to a local-scale area. I think it's a good assumption to start with, and I would think it would underestimate the effects of cooling strategies at the local-scale on  Tair micro-advection. Which is nice.. because then you can speak to minimum impacts.  

%The storage heat flux (\glssymbol{DeltaS}) calculations are based on the Local-scale Urban Meteorological Parameterisation Scheme (LUMPS) \citep{Grimmond2002a}.  

The \glssymbol{DeltaS} for the $ith$ land cover class is calculated using an adapted version of the objective hysteresis model (OHM) \citep{Grimmond2002a}: 
%The OHM model is adapted to calculate the \glssymbol{DeltaS} for each surface type using: 


%For non-water surfaces, the sensible (\glssymbol{H}) and latent (\glssymbol{LE}) heat fluxes for the $ith$ surface type are calculated using:


%\begin{equation} 
%\glssymbol{H} = 
%\frac{(1-\glssymbol{pm}_{i})+(\frac{\glssymbol{gamma}}{\glssymbol{s}})}{1+\frac{\glssymbol{gamma}}{\glssymbol{s}}}
%(R_{n,i} -\glssymbol{DeltaS})- \glssymbol{beta}
%\label{eq:Hi} \end{equation} 

%\begin{equation} 
%\glssymbol{LE} = 
%\frac{\glssymbol{pm}_{i}}{1+\frac{\glssymbol{gamma}}{\glssymbol{s}}}
%(R_{n,i}-\glssymbol{DeltaS})+ \glssymbol{beta}
%\label{eq:LE} \end{equation} where \glssymbol{s} is the slope of the saturation vapour pressure-versus-temperature curve, \glssymbol{gamma} is the psychrometric constant and \glssymbol{pm}$_{i}$ and \glssymbol{beta} are based on a simplification of the Penman-Monteith approach, which takes into account the Priestley-Taylor coefficient; \glssymbol{pm}$_{i}$ depends on the surface moisture status, and \glssymbol{beta} is an empirical constant set at 3 W m$^{-2}$ \citep{Grimmond2002a}. By default, the \glssymbol{pm} parameter is set using values from \cite{Hanna1992} (Table \ref{tab:surftype}). 
%Alternatively, \glssymbol{pm} for vegetated classes can be defined as a function of stomatal resistance $(r_{st})$ using $\glssymbol{pm} = 6.9\times10^{-6} r_{st}^{2} - 0.004 sr + 1.3$ \citep{DeBruin1983}.  


\begin{equation} 
\glssymbol{DeltaS} = R_{n,i} a_{1,i} + \Big( \frac{\partial R_{n,i}}{\partial t}   \Big) a_{2,i} + a_{3,i}
\label{eq:ohm} \end{equation} where  $\frac{\partial R_{n,i}}{\partial t} =0.5(R_{n,i,(t-1)} - R_{n,i,(t+1)})$ and the three $a$ coefficients  are defined using cited values for each surface (see Table \ref{tab:Parameter}). The $a$ coefficients capture the hysteresis pattern commonly observed between the \glssymbol{Rn} and \glssymbol{DeltaS} in urban areas. See \cite{Grimmond1999b} for a full description of the OHM and the role of the $a$ parameters in \glssymbol{DeltaS} calculations. The \glssymbol{DeltaS}  is then used to calculate the \glssymbol{Tsf} for each land cover type using the force-restore method.



%The parameter a1 indicates the overall strength of the dependence of the storage heat flux on net radiation. The parameter a2 describes the degree and direction of the phase relations between QS and Q*. When a2 is positive, QS precedes the peak in Q*; when it is zero, the two curves are exactly in phase, that is, there is no hysteresis. The parameter a3 is an intercept term that indicates the relative timing when QS and Q* turn negative. A large a3 coefficient indicates QS becomes negative much earlier than Q*; it is the size of QS when Q* becomes negative. 




\subsection{Surface temperature calculation (`force-restore')}\label{sec:tsurf}

%% not used for trees - mention this. 
The force-restore method is an efficient method for calculating surface temperature \citep{bhumralkar1975,deardorff1978}, and is an alternative to multilayer conduction approaches used in other climate models. The force-restore method is used to ensure that the model remains computationally efficient.  The ground layer is conceptually divided into two layers with uniform vertical temperature: a thin surface layer and deep soil layer. The forcing term, which is driven by \glssymbol{DeltaS} , heats the surface layer. The restore term, driven by deep soil temperature, dampens the forcing term. The change in surface temperature \glssymbol{Tsf} for surface $i$, with respect to time $(t)$, is calculated as \citep{jacobs2000}:


\begin{equation} 
\frac{\partial T_{surf,i}} {\partial t}= \frac{\glssymbol{DeltaS}}{C_{i} D} - \frac{2 \pi}{\tau} (T_{surf,i,[t-1]} - T_{m,i,[t-1]})
\label{eq:force} \end{equation} where $C_{i}$ is the \glsdesc{C}, $\tau$ is the period (86400 seconds), $D$ is the damping depth of the diurnal temperature wave $D = 2 \glssymbol{kappa}  / \omega 0.5$, $\omega = 2\pi / \tau$, and \glssymbol{kappa} represents thermal diffusivity.  The \glsdesc{Tm} (\glssymbol{Tm}) is calculated using:


\begin{equation} 
\frac{\partial T_{m,i}}{\partial t} = \frac{\Delta \glssymbol{DeltaS}}{C_{i} D_{y}}
\label{eq:tm} \end{equation} where \glssymbol{Dy} = $D \sqrt{365}$, the \glsdesc{Dy}. 

The force-restore method, which assumes two layers each of uniform temperature, cannot be applied to more complex surfaces such as water, trees, walls, or roofs. For  roofs  we set \glssymbol{C} at realistic value and use \glssymbol{kappa} as a tuning parameter to represent layers of thermally active mass characteristic of most building roofs, which are often thinner than ground level surfaces.  This approach produces accurate \glssymbol{Tsf}$_{,roof}$ results (see Section \ref{sec:landcoversim}), but ongoing work is needed to represent roofs in a physically realistic  and  efficient manner. For simplicity, the wall surfaces are assumed to have to same thermal properties as roofs. For trees, we assume that \glssymbol{Tsf}$_{,tree}$ is equal to \glssymbol{Ta} (see Figure \ref{fig:TreeTsurfvsTair} for justification), and a simple water body model is used to calculate \glssymbol{Tsf}$_{,watr}$.


\subsection{Simple water body model}\label{sec:simplewater}

The water model is used for modelling small inland water bodies, such as lakes and wetlands. The water model in  \glssymbol{Toolkit2} is based on a single water layer, overlaying a soil layer. Essentially, the force-restore surface temperature model is implemented, and is overlain by a homogeneous mixed water layer (i.e. neglecting thermal stratification) representing a water body of depth \glssymbol{zwatr} (m). The model is designed to apply to water bodies of 0.1--1.0 m depths. The water model is based on the pan evaporation model of \cite{MolinaMartinez2006}, which closely follows that of the lake model of \cite{Jacobs1998}. The water body model also determines the surface energy balance of the water surface. The energy balance model for the water layer is given by \cite{MolinaMartinez2006}:

\begin{equation} 
\glssymbol{Sab} + \glssymbol{l*} + \glssymbol{Hwatr} - \glssymbol{LEwatr} - \glssymbol{Gwatr} -\glssymbol{deltaSwatr} = 0
\label{eq:sab} \end{equation} where \glssymbol{Sab} is \glsdesc{Sab}, \glssymbol{l*}, the \glsdesc{l*}, \glssymbol{Gwatr} is the \glsdesc{Gwatr}, and \glssymbol{deltaSwatr} is the \glsdesc{deltaSwatr}. Solar radiation penetrates the water surface and is absorbed as described by Beer's Law \citep{MolinaMartinez2006}:

\begin{equation} 
\glssymbol{Sab} = \glssymbol{k*} \big[ \glssymbol{betak} + (1 - \glssymbol{betak}) )(1-e^{-\glssymbol{eta}})  \big]
\label{eq:sab2} \end{equation} where \glssymbol{k*} is the \glsdesc{k*}, \glssymbol{betak} is the \glsdesc{betak} \citep{MolinaMartinez2006}, and \glssymbol{eta} the \glsdesc{eta}. Here, \glssymbol{eta} is given the following from \cite{Subin2012a}, for the water layer with depth \glssymbol{zwatr} $(m)$:

\begin{equation} 
\glssymbol{eta} = 1.1925 \glssymbol{zwatr}^{-0.424}
\label{eq:eta} \end{equation} A correction factor for the solar path length zenith angle is often applied to eq. \ref{eq:sab2} \citep{MolinaMartinez2006} but this has been omitted from TARGET to reduce complexity. 

The conductive heat transport \glssymbol{Gwatr} into the soil at the base of the water layer is given by \cite{MolinaMartinez2006}:

\begin{equation} 
\glssymbol{Gwatr} = - \glssymbol{Cwatr} \glssymbol{kwatr} \frac{\Delta T}{\Delta \glssymbol{zwatr}}
\label{eq:gwatr} \end{equation} where \glssymbol{Cwatr} is the \glsdesc{Cwatr}, \glssymbol{kwatr} is the \glsdesc{kwatr}, 
and the change in depth $\Delta \glssymbol{zwatr} = \glssymbol{zwatr}$ (the depth of the water layer). \glssymbol{kwatr} is a complex function accounting for thermal stratification of water and surface friction velocity. To reduce complexity and assuming a mixed homogeneous water layer, a constant \glssymbol{kwatr} has been selected based on shallow lakes reported in \cite{SalasDeLeon2016}. The change in temperature $\Delta T$ (\degreeC) is the difference between the water temperature \glssymbol{Tsf}$_{watr}$ (\degreeC) and the soil temperature beneath the water layer \glssymbol{Tsoilw} (\degreeC). \glssymbol{Tsoilw} is calculated using the force-restore model where \glssymbol{Gwatr} is equivalent to \glssymbol{DeltaS} in eq. \ref{eq:force}:

\begin{equation}
\frac{d \glssymbol{Tsoilw}}{d t}= \frac{(\glssymbol{Gwatr} + (\glssymbol{k*} - \glssymbol{Sab}))}{C_{watr} D} - \frac{2 \pi}{\tau} (T_{soil,[t-1]} - T_{m,[t-1]})
\end{equation} To represent the radiation that is not absorbed by the water, but is absorbed by the underlying soil layer, $\glssymbol{k*} - \glssymbol{Sab}$ is added to \glssymbol{Gwatr}.

The latent heat flux (\glssymbol{LEwatr}) (W m$^{-2}$) is given by \cite{Arya2001}:

\begin{equation} 
\glssymbol{LEwatr} = \glssymbol{rhov} \glssymbol{Lv} \glssymbol{hv} \glssymbol{Uz} (\glssymbol{qs} - \glssymbol{qa})
\label{eq:lewtr} \end{equation} where \glssymbol{rhov} is the \glsdesc{rhov}, \glssymbol{Lv} is the \glsdesc{Lv}, \glssymbol{hv} is bulk transfer coefficient for moisture $(1.4\times10^{-3})$ \citep{Hicks1972,Jones2005}, \glssymbol{Uz} is the reference wind speed, \glssymbol{qs} the saturated specific humidity at \glssymbol{Tsf}$_{watr}$, and \glssymbol{qa} is the specific humidity of the air for the given \glssymbol{Ta}. 

The sensible heat flux above the water surface is given by \cite{MolinaMartinez2006}:
%\footnote{The temperature gradient (\glssymbol{Ta}-\glssymbol{Tsoilw}) in Eq. 6 from \cite{MolinaMartinez2006} pg. 254 is reversed here from the usual (\glssymbol{Tsoilw}-\glssymbol{Ta}). It accounts for the addition of sensible heat to the water layer from the energy balance equation (Eq. \ref{eq:rn2}.}

\begin{equation} 
Q_{H,watr} = \glssymbol{rhoa} \glssymbol{cp} \glssymbol{hc} \glssymbol{Uz} (\glssymbol{Ta}-\glssymbol{Tsoilw})
\label{eq:hwtr} \end{equation} where \glssymbol{rhoa} is the \glsdesc{rhoa}, \glssymbol{cp} the \glsdesc{cp}, and \glssymbol{hc} the \glsdesc{hc}. 

Returning to eq. \ref{eq:sab2}, net long wave radiation \glssymbol{l*} = \glssymbol{Rn} - \glssymbol{k*}, leaving $\glssymbol{deltaSwatr}$ from the energy balance equation, which is defined as \citep{MolinaMartinez2006}:

\begin{equation} 
\glssymbol{deltaSwatr} = \glssymbol{Cwatr} \glssymbol{zwatr} \frac{\Delta T_{surf,watr}}{\Delta t}
\label{eq:swrt} \end{equation} where $\Delta t$ is change in time (seconds) and \glssymbol{Cwatr} is the \glsdesc{Cwatr}. Solving for $\Delta$ $T_{surf,watr}$ and adding the change in temperature to the previous time step ($T_{surf,watr} = T_{surf,watr,[t-1]}  + \Delta T_{surf,watr}$) gives the new water layer temperature.

%The domain \glssymbol{Tb} is calculated for each timestep  using reference meteorological data (Section \ref{sec:datainputs}). A bulk Richardson number (\glssymbol{Ri}) between the land surface (`low' level) and the \glssymbol{Ta} measurement  height ('high' level) is calculated as:
%\begin{equation}
%Ri = \cfrac{(g/T_{v}) \Delta z  \Delta \Theta_{v}}{\glssymbol{Uhigh}} \label{eq:Ri} \end{equation} where $g$ is acceleration due to gravity, $\Delta z$ is height difference between the two levels, $\Delta \Theta_{v}$ was the change in potential temperature over z, $T_{v}$ =  $0.5(\glssymbol{Thigh} + \glssymbol{Tlow})$ where \glssymbol{Thigh} = \glssymbol{Ta} and \glssymbol{Tlow} = \glssymbol{Tsf}, and \glssymbol{Uhigh} is the wind speed at the \glssymbol{Ta} measurement height.  Assuming \glssymbol{Ri} is constant in the surface layer, we calculate \glssymbol{Tb} by solving equation 9 for \glssymbol{Thigh}, with $z = 3 \times max(\glssymbol{BH})$, \glssymbol{Tlow} = \glssymbol{Ta}, and \glssymbol{Uhigh} = wind speed at $3 \times  max(\glssymbol{BH})$ (calculated assuming logarithmic relationship).



\subsection{Calculation of urban canopy layer air temperature (\glssymbol{Tac}) }\label{sec:calcTac}

To calculate \glssymbol{Tac} we first calculate a domain \glssymbol{Tb} for each timestep. Assuming air temperature at 3 times building height (3H) is consistent between the neighbourhood of interest and the reference weather station location, we extrapolate reference air temperature at measurement height to 3H assuming a constant flux layer and using a bulk Richardson number-based approximation \citep{Mascart1995}. Through this simple calculation we define a domain constant \glssymbol{Tb} with basic representation of atmospheric stability in \glssymbol{Toolkit2}.  

The canyon air temperature is then calculated using a modified version of the canopy air temperature equation from the Community Land Model Urban (CLMU) \citep{Oleson2010}:

\begin{equation}
 \label{eq:tac}
  \glssymbol{Tac} = 
  \frac{\begin{gathered} (T_{surf,asph} \glssymbol{Hcs} F_{asph}) +  (T_{surf,conc} \glssymbol{Hcs} F_{conc}) +  (T_{surf,gras} \glssymbol{Hcs} F_{gras}) + (T_{surf,irgs} \glssymbol{Hcs} F_{irgs}) + (T_{surf,tree} \glssymbol{Hcs} F_{tree})  + \\ T_{surf,wall} \glssymbol{Hcs} F_{wall}) +   (T_{surf,watr} \glssymbol{Hcs} F_{asph}) +  \Bigg[\frac{T_{surf,roof}}  {(\frac{1}{\glssymbol{Hcs}}+\frac{1}{\glssymbol{Hca}})} F_{roof}\Bigg] + (\glssymbol{Tb} \glssymbol{Hca} \glssymbol{W})\end{gathered}}{\begin{gathered} 
      (\glssymbol{Hcs} F_{asph}) +   (\glssymbol{Hcs} F_{conc}) +  ( \glssymbol{Hcs} F_{gras}) + ( \glssymbol{Hcs} F_{irgs}) + ( \glssymbol{Hcs} F_{tree})  +  (\glssymbol{Hcs} F_{wall}) +   (\glssymbol{Hcs} F_{asph}) + \\ \Bigg[\frac{F_{roof}}{(\frac{1}{\glssymbol{Hcs}}+\frac{1}{\glssymbol{Hca}})}\Bigg] +(\glssymbol{Hca} \glssymbol{W}) \end{gathered}}
\end{equation} where $F_{i} $ is the 2-D fractional coverage of surface $i$ in the canyon,  \glssymbol{Hcs} is the \glsdesc{Hcs}, and \glssymbol{Hca} is the \glsdesc{Hca}.
In equation \ref{eq:tac} we assume roofs are connected to the canyon via two resistances in series, thus representing the  additional impediment to transfer of heat from a rooftop into the canyon.  The \glssymbol{Hca} is calculated following \cite{Masson2000} and using the stability coefficients from \cite{Mascart1995}. %In order to calculate \glssymbol{Hca} a grid point specific \glssymbol{Ri} is calculated using equation \ref{eq:Ri}  with  \glssymbol{Thigh} = \glssymbol{Tb} and $\glssymbol{Tlow} = (F_{roof} \glssymbol{Tsf}_{,roof}) + (\glssymbol{lambdaC} \glssymbol{Tac}_{[t-1]})$. 
The \glssymbol{Hcs} term is from \cite{Masson2000}:

\begin{equation} 
\glssymbol{rs} = \frac{\glssymbol{rhoa}\glssymbol{cp}}{11.8+4.2\glssymbol{Ucan}}
\label{eq:rs} \end{equation} where $\glssymbol{Hcs} = \frac{1}{\glssymbol{rs}}$ and \glssymbol{Ucan} is the \glsdesc{Ucan} \citep{Kusaka2001}: 

\begin{equation} 
\glssymbol{Ucan} = \glssymbol{Utop} exp{ \Bigg( -0.386 \frac{\glssymbol{BH}}{\glssymbol{W}} \Bigg)}
\label{eq:ucan} \end{equation} where \glssymbol{Utop} is the \glsdesc{Utop}. \glssymbol{Utop} is estimated at the top of the UCL based on \glssymbol{Uz} using a logarithmic relationship.



%To obtain \glssymbol{Tac} we first calculate the canyon average  \glssymbol{Tsf} and $Q_{H}$ for the current  model grid point using land cover fractions. The canyon average \glssymbol{Tsf} is simply calculated as:
%\begin{equation} 
%\glssymbol{Tsf} = \sum \limits_{i=1}^8 \frac{A_i}{\glssymbol{Acan}} \glssymbol{Tsf}_{,i}
%\label{eq:tsurf} \end{equation} where $A_{i}$ is the area of land cover type and \glssymbol{Acan} is the \glsdesc{Acan}. 

%Next the canyon average $Q_{H}$ is calculated. To account for the additional heat flux (Wm$^{-2}$) from vertical wall surfaces, the canyon average $Q_{H}$ is defined  as:
%\begin{equation} \label{eq:Hcan}
%Q_{H} = \sum \limits_{i=1}^8 \frac{A_i}{\glssymbol{Ahorz}} \glssymbol{H}
%\end{equation} where $i$ includes each surface and \glssymbol{Ahorz} is the \glsdesc{Ahorz}. Eq. \ref{eq:Hcan} determines the plan area average of the sensible heat fluxes over the total 3-D surface. 

%ensures the \glssymbol{H} is proportional to the total area of vertical and horizontal surfaces. 
%that sites with greater vertical wall area have a greater \glssymbol{H}. 

%The \glssymbol{Tac} term is then calculated following the approach outlined in Figure \ref{fig:Tac}. Toolkit-2 has  simple representation of the vertical exchange of heat from the urban surface to the UCL, but does not represent any horizontal heat transfer (advection) between model grid points.  The \glssymbol{Tac} term is calculated as a function of \glssymbol{Tsf} and the air temperature above the canyon \glssymbol{Tb}. \glssymbol{Tb} is calculated using $Q_{H}$, as this term represents the canyon average sensible heat flux. Hence, we rearrange the following equation to calculate \glssymbol{Tb} \citep{Yang2013}: 
%\begin{equation} 
%Q_{H} = \glssymbol{rhoa} \glssymbol{cp} \frac{\glssymbol{Ta}-\glssymbol{Tb}}{\glssymbol{ra}}
%\label{eq:H_air} \end{equation} where \glssymbol{cp} is the \glsdesc{cp}, \glssymbol{Ta} is the \glsdesc{Ta}, and \glssymbol{rhoa} is the \glsdesc{rhoa}. 

% \begin{figure}[!htbp]
%\fbox{
%\includegraphics[width=1\textwidth,keepaspectratio]{images/Tair_schematic.png}
%}
% \caption{Schematic of the air temperature module.} \label{fig:Tac}
%\end{figure}

%To account for the exchange of heat between the  \glssymbol{Tac} and \glssymbol{Tb}, we characterize  resistance of  sensible heat above the urban canopy (\glssymbol{ra}) as \citep{lindroth1993,Yang2013}:

%\begin{equation} 
%\glssymbol{ra} = \frac{ln^{2} \Bigg( \frac{\glssymbol{zu}-\glssymbol{d}}{\glssymbol{z0}}   \Bigg)   } {k^{2} \glssymbol{Uz}}
%\label{eq:ra} \end{equation} where \glssymbol{zu} is the observed reference wind speed measurement height (typically 10 m), %\glssymbol{d} is the \glsdesc{d}, and \glssymbol{z0} is the \glsdesc{z0}. 


%The temperature of the canopy layer (\glssymbol{Tac}) is then given by \cite{Oleson2010}:

%\begin{equation} 
%\glssymbol{Tac} = \frac{\glssymbol{Hca} + \glssymbol{Tb} + \glssymbol{Hcs} + \glssymbol{Tsf} }  { \glssymbol{Hca}  + \glssymbol{Hcs} }
%\label{eq:tac} \end{equation} which is a simplification of Equation 3.75 (eq. \ref{eq:clmu375}) in the Community Land Model Urban technical notes \citep{Oleson2010}; because we do not consider sensible heat conductance for individual surface types. Sensible heat conductance are given for the urban canopy layer to atmosphere (\glssymbol{Hca}) and surface to urban canopy layer (\glssymbol{Hcs}) by \citep{Oleson2010}:

%\begin{equation} 
%\glssymbol{Utop} = \glssymbol{Uz} \frac{ ln \big( \frac{\glssymbol{BH}}{\glssymbol{z0}}  \big)}{ ln \big( %\frac{\glssymbol{zu}}{\glssymbol{z0}}  \big) }
%\label{eq:xx4} \end{equation}

%If \glssymbol{BH} is below the domain average building height, it should be set to the domain average. 

\section{Methods and data}\label{sec:validation}
\subsection{Overview}\label{sec:validationover}


As part of the model evaluation, we conducted a range of simulations that test model performance for both \glssymbol{Tsf} and \glssymbol{Tac}. These validation experiments are focused on clear sky summertime conditions. Clear sky conditions were chosen because the local-cooling effects of GBI are most notable during warm, clear-sky, summer conditions. We tested the model's ability to simulate \glssymbol{Tsf} for each land cover type that can be prescribed in \glssymbol{Toolkit2} (i.e. dry grass, asphalt etc.), using ground-based observations of \glssymbol{Tsf} (Section \ref{sec:landcoversim}). These simulations by land cover type, provide a detailed assessment of model parameters, and the underlying energy balance dynamics and resulting \glssymbol{Tsf} for each land cover class. Secondly we conducted suburb scale simulations of Mawson Lakes, Adelaide, for which we have high resolution remotely sensed \glssymbol{Tsf} observations and in situ \glssymbol{Tac} data (Section \ref{sec:suburbsim}).  The suburb scale simulations reflect the way the model is intended to be used by practitioners.



\subsection{Land cover simulations}\label{sec:landcoversim} 

To test model performance at simulating \glssymbol{Tsf} of different land cover classes and perform sensitivity analysis on a number of model parameters, we used ground-based observations of \glssymbol{Tsf} from the Melbourne metropolitan area. \cite{Coutts2016a} deployed infrared temperature sensors (SI-121 - Apogee), during February 2012, across a range of land cover types including: asphalt, concrete, grass, irrigated grass, steel roof, and water. The conditions during this period represented near-typical summertime conditions in Melbourne; including a number of days (15th, 24th, and 25th February) where air temperature exceeded 30 \degreeC (see Figure \ref{fig:met}). These hotter days were characterised by northerly winds, which bring hot and dry air from Australia's interior, and often result in heatwave conditions in Melbourne. Additionally, there was at least one cloudy day where incoming shortwave radiation (\glssymbol{kdown}) dropped significantly and negligible amount of rainfall occurred (17th February). 




\subsection{Suburb scale simulations (Mawson Lakes)}\label{sec:suburbsim} 
 
In addition to the land cover category testing, we also conducted suburb scale simulations of \glssymbol{Tsf} and \glssymbol{Tac} for Mawson Lakes, Adelaide (Figure \ref{fig:mawson}). The suburb scale simulations used observational data from the Mawson Lakes field campaign, conducted 13-18th February 2011, which represented average summertime conditions in Adelaide \citep{Broadbent2017}. For these simulations, the model was run on a 30 m grid over the Mawson Lakes suburb for the period 13th--18th February (Figure \ref{fig:met3}).  Remotely sensed land cover data from the campaign were used to define land cover, and building morphology was defined using LiDAR data (see \cite{Broadbent2017}). The Mawson Lakes simulations used the same parameter setup as above (summarised in Table \ref{tab:Parameter}), and were forced with meteorological data from the Kent Town Bureau of Meteorology (ID 023090) weather station. Modelled \glssymbol{Tsf} was validated using observed remotely sensed \glssymbol{Tsf} (night - 15th February and day - 16th February), which was resampled to 30 m resolution \citep{Broadbent2017}. To validate \glssymbol{Tac}, we use data from 27 automatic weather station (AWS) that were also deployed during the Mawson Lakes field campaign (see Figure \ref{fig:mawson} for AWS locations).

\section{Model evaluation results}\label{sec:Results} 
\subsection{Land cover simulations}\label{sec:landcoverresult} 


The surface temperature for each land cover class was simulated for a 14 day period during February 2012. The results show that modelled surface temperature for all 3 impervious surfaces (concrete, asphalt, and roof) were reasonably well predicted with mean bias errors (MBE) of 0.88, -0.22, and -1.16 \degreeC, respectively (Figure \ref{fig:Tsurf_panel}a--f). The root mean square error (RMSE) values for impervious surfaces were around 3.5--4 \degreeC. These RMSE values represent about 15\% of diurnal \glssymbol{Tsf} variation, which implies good model skill given the simplicity of the approach.  


%Roof and concrete \glssymbol{Tsf} was generally slightly over-predicted at night (lower \glssymbol{Tsf}) and under-predicted at the daily maximanigh (higher \glssymbol{Tsf}); these patterns are commonly observed in other land surface models.  For asphalt, \glssymbol{Tsf} was generally over-predicted at all temperatures.

The night of the 16 February was not well captured at the concrete and asphalt sites. The $T_{surf,conc}$ and $T_{surf,asph}$ were under-predicted (up to 5\degreeC cooler than observations) on the night of 16 February, which may have been caused by warm air advection. The \glssymbol{Toolkit2} approach  cannot account for the effects of warm air advection on surface temperature, as there is not feedback between \glssymbol{Tac} and \glssymbol{Tsf}.  Despite this limitation, the broad timing and magnitude of heating and cooling was well captured for all three impervious land cover types.

All time series plots are for the period 11 -- 25 February.

%\end{figure}

Model performance for  $T_{surf,watr}$ had a low MBE of 0.91\degreeC but the $r^{2}$ value of 0.76 suggests the model captured diurnal $T_{surf,watr}$  variation less accurately than other surfaces (Figure \ref{fig:Tsurf_panel}g--h). In particular, daily maximum $T_{surf,watr}$ were under-predicted on hotter days (e.g. 14th February). \glssymbol{Toolkit2} uses a different module for water bodies (see Section \ref{sec:simplewater}). This simple module treats water as a single layer overlying soil. 
%It may be that a multi-layer water body model is needed to more accurately capture water \glssymbol{Tsf} on hot days.  
Despite the under-prediction on 14 February, the simple water body model can reproduce  $T_{surf,watr}$ to an acceptable standard. 

Modelled $T_{surf,irgs}$ had a MBE (-1.56\degreeC) comparable to that of impervious surfaces (Figure \ref{fig:Tsurf_panel}i--j). However, the RMSE for irrigated grass (3.69\degreeC) represents approximately 20\% of diurnal $T_{surf,igrs}$ variation, suggesting model error is slightly higher than for the impervious surfaces. Generally  $T_{surf,igrs}$ was slightly over-predicted at night  and under-predicted at the daily maxima. This skewing of the scatter plot suggests that thermal interia is too high in the model. Overall, the model was skillful enough to capture the timing and amplitude of  $T_{surf,igrs}$. 

Dry grass had a small MBE error (0.06 \degreeC), but the largest RMSE of the surfaces tested (4.38 \degreeC). However, this RMSE only equated to approximately 10--15\% of diurnal $T_{surf,gras}$ variability (Figure \ref{fig:Tsurf_panel}k--l) as dry grass had the largest amplitude of surface temperature variability. Dry grass exhibited the same skewing in the scatterplot as irrigated grass, with a general over-prediction of night-time temperatures and under-prediction of daytime maxima.

%Model performance for water \glssymbol{Tsf} had a low RMSE of 2.31\degreeC, but the $r^{2}$ value of 0.76 suggests \glssymbol{Tsf} was predicted less accurately than other surfaces (Figure \ref{fig:Tsurf_panel}g--h). In particular, daily maxima were under-predicted on hotter days (e.g. 14th February). \glssymbol{Toolkit2} uses a different module for water bodies (see section \ref{sec:simplewater}).

\subsubsection{Suburb scale simulations (Mawson Lakes)}\label{sec:suburbresult} 
\subsubsection*{Surface temperature}\label{sec:surftempresult} 



In addition to the land cover simulations we conducted suburb scale modelling of the Mawson Lakes suburb. These simulations reveal how the \glssymbol{Toolkit2} model can be operationalised by practitioners who want to assess the cooling benefits of blue infrastructure or greening initiatives. Suburb scale simulations were conducted using the same parameters as above (Table \ref{tab:Parameter}). Figure \ref{fig:MawsonBase} shows the predicted \glssymbol{Tsf} (30 m average) for the Mawson Lakes domain plotted against observed \glssymbol{Tsf} (30m). The Mawson Lakes simulations revealed the initial conditions of the \glssymbol{Tm} parameter (which represents the average temperature in the ground layer) are  important for good model performance. A spin-up period (1 month) had to be used to obtain initial \glssymbol{Tm} values for each surface type. This can be quickly and easily achieved by running the force-restore module for a single point for each surface type. A future version of the model will automatically spin-up intial \glssymbol{Tm} values. The model output also shows that some of input land cover is poorly categorised, resulting in population of grid points where modelled \glssymbol{Tsf} is  over-predicted. Additionally, errors in the observed \glssymbol{Tsf} caused by heterogeneity of roof emissivity,  also contribute to apparent inaccuracies of modelled \glssymbol{Tsf}. In general, the daytime \glssymbol{Tsf} was slightly over-predicted and the complexity of spatial variability was not fully captured. However, this is a positive result given only 8 land cover classes are represented in the model. Overall, the daytime \glssymbol{Tsf} was well predicted with the range and magnitude of \glssymbol{Tsf} captured by the model. 

The results suggest that night-time \glssymbol{Tsf} was under-predicted by model. The range of modelled nocturnal \glssymbol{Tsf} variability (c. 8 \degreeC) was much smaller than observed variability (c. 18\degreeC). This under-prediction of variability could reflect the fact that some processes that dictate the rate of nocturnal cooling are not fully accounted for in this approach. Nevertheless, the general spatial patterns of \glssymbol{Tsf} are captured well. Further, given that the  range of \glssymbol{Tsf} is smaller at night, this under-prediction is of minimal consequence for modelled \glssymbol{Tac}. The nocturnal \glssymbol{Tsf} of impervious surfaces was also under-predicted in the land cover simulations (i.e. Section \ref{sec:landcoverresult}) under warm advection conditions. Although warm advection conditions were not observed during the Mawson Lakes campaign, it is worthwhile further investigating this phenomenon, in future work, to negate its effect and improve nocturnal \glssymbol{Tsf} accuracy.

Note: \glssymbol{Tsf} here does not include $T_{surf,wall}$ for comparison with horizontally averaged aerial imagery observations.} \label{fig:MawsonBase}
\end{sidewaysfigure}

 


\subsubsection*{Air temperature}\label{sec:airtempresult} 


Spatial plots of modelled 3am and 3pm \glssymbol{Tac} are shown in Figure \ref{fig:MawsonModelledTas}. The lack of advection representation in the \glssymbol{Toolkit2}  means no horizontal mixing of heat, which exaggerates the spatial variability of simulated \glssymbol{Tac}. However, the general patterns of \glssymbol{Tac} are reasonable and as expected. We also extracted modelled \glssymbol{Tac} from the grid points where the 27 AWS were located (grid points were centred at the AWS) for a 2 day period (15-16th February 2011) (Figure \ref{fig:MawsonModObs}). The \glssymbol{Tac} was generally well predicted (Figure \ref{fig:MawsonModObs}), with a RMSE of 2.0 \degreeC. These results are about the same accuracy as simulations, from the same site, conducted using a more sophisticated and computationally expensive urban climate model called SURFEX \citep{Broadbent}.   Although a simple model, TARGET appears as accurate as more complex models. Additionally, TARGET does not require the user to provide  above canyon forcing data (e.g. \glssymbol{Tb}), which is needed for other  models and is  not easily obtained.  \glssymbol{Toolkit2}  tended  to over-predict average \glssymbol{Tac} at all urban sites (Figure \ref{fig:MawsonBox}).  Residential sites (\TAfourS cluster [red]) were  too warm during the day. This over-prediction is likely due to the uniform wall and roof thermal parameters used, which are not representative of residential areas. By contrast, the \TAfiveS cluster is too cool at night. The model predicts the formation of a stable layer with cool air trapped near the surface. Overall, the diurnal range and average \glssymbol{Tac} are well captured by the model. 

Finally, there is some hysteresis in Figure \ref{fig:MawsonModelledTas}, indicating that modelled \glssymbol{Tac} is slightly out-of-sync with observed \glssymbol{Tac}. This could be due to the approach used to  diagnose \glssymbol{Tb}, which assumes a constant \glssymbol{Ri} in the surface layer, and therefore heats up too quickly during the morning. Improvement in the \glssymbol{Tb}  term is  an area for future model development. However, we believe it is important to calculate \glssymbol{Tb}, as this makes the model much more accessible to non-expert users. Given the simplicity and computational efficiency of the model approaches used, \glssymbol{Toolkit2} shows good skill for predicting urban \glssymbol{Tac}.Overall, the air temperature evaluation shows we can have confidence in the accuracy of the model and its potential for application by practitioners. 


%Additionally, the model does not account for changes in atmospheric stability, which can significantly influence exchanges of heat between the atmosphere and the UCL, especially at night. Representation of the effects of atmospheric stability  and horizontal advection are key areas for exploration for future development in \glssymbol{Toolkit2}, while balancing model complexity and accuracy.

\section{Heat mitigation scenarios}

To demonstrate how TARGET can be used by practitioners  to predict GBI cooling impacts, two simple heat mitigation scenarios are presented: (1) a doubling of existing tree cover (`2$\times$TREE') (Figure \ref{fig:tree_scen}) and (2) all dry grass is converted to irrigated grass (`IRRIGATION') (Figure \ref{fig:irr_scen}). The `2$\times$TREE' scenario assumes a maximum tree coverage of 75\%.   The results presented here represent the local spatial maximum cooling potential of GBI. In reality, the cooling local magnitude will be decreased by advection, which TARGET does not represent. 

The 2$\times$TREE scenario  shows maximum cooling of  3.15 \degreeC during the day and smaller effect ($< 0.25$ \degreeC) at night (Figure \ref{fig:tree_scen}).  The IRRIGATION scenarios suggests that increasing irrigation can have a small warming effect ($< 0.75$ \degreeC) at night, and  cooling of up to  1.75 \degreeC at 3 pm (Figure \ref{fig:irr_scen}).  The amount of  land cover change differs in each scenario. As such, we calculate the cooling sensitivity $(\gamma)$ as:
\begin{equation}
\gamma = \big(\frac{\Delta \glssymbol{Tac}}{\Delta LC}\big)
\end{equation}where $\Delta LC$ is the average land cover change (\%) (Table \ref{tab:cooling_scen}). Model results suggests that trees  are about 1.5 times more effective at providing cooling at 3 pm (Table \ref{tab:cooling_scen}). Over the course of a day, trees are predicted to be 4 times more effective at cooling than irrigation. The results for both heat mitigation simulations are  within the expected magnitudes based on previous heat mitigation modelling studies \citep{grossman2010,middel2015urban,daniel2016,Broadbent}. These simulations demonstrate that TARGET not only reproduces observations accurately, but can be used with confidence to efficiently assess the efficacy of heat mitigation measures.

\section{Limitations of the model}

% we think that this model works well for it's purposes - balancing model performance and simplicity. 

%If you are going to include a whole section about limitations (which is not a bad thing) is it not only fair that a similar amount of content be delivered on the model advantages...? Otherwise, what's the point. The advantages outweigh the limitations, and end users are crying out for a tool like this.

%Could this section be "Advantages and limitation of the model"

As discussed above, \glssymbol{Toolkit2} aims to be a simple and accessible urban climate model that provides scientifically defensible and accurate urban temperature predictions. To achieve simplicity the model necessarily makes some  assumptions and omissions that users should be aware of.   \glssymbol{Toolkit2} is primarily intended to model urban microclimate characteristics during clear sky conditions. The model does not simulate rainfall and therefore should not be used for periods containing significant precipitation. Further, the model can be used to simulate urban microclimate for days to weeks (i.e. a heatwave), but has not been tested or validated for longer scale simulations (i.e. months to years). 

For computational efficiency, the model assumes no horizontal advection (inside or above) the UCL. In general, advection reduces the microscale impacts (i.e. cooling directly adjacent the cooling intervention) of GBI due to atmospheric mixing, and therefore we expect \glssymbol{Toolkit2} to provide estimates of near maximum microscale cooling benefits. In reality, microscale cooling effects will be diminished by advection, especially during the day and during high wind conditions.

As mentioned, the force-restore method is used for roof and wall surfaces with an artificially reduced \glssymbol{kappa} value. Although this approach generally performed well, it is our intention to develop and integrate a more realistic formula for modelling roof and wall \glssymbol{DeltaS}. A conduction model, although more computationally expensive, would allow more flexibility as different types of roofs (which do vary significantly) could be represented. Furthermore, wall surfaces are treated the same as roofs in \glssymbol{Toolkit2}, which is unrealistic. Improved representation of walls and roofs are key areas for future model development.  
%Additionally, not validation of \glssymbol{Tsf}$_{wall}$ was  conducted. A


%Also absent from the model are realistic shading effects from trees, which are represented at ground-level. Surfaces beneath trees are effectively removed from the model as media that can store and exchange energy. Therefore, the surfaces beneath trees have no thermal mass. An improved method for representing tree shading is key feature to be added to \glssymbol{Toolkit2}. This is obviously of critical importance, particularly for human thermal comfort calculations.  

In addition, 
%the model has no  representation of atmospheric stability on \glssymbol{Tac}. Although wind speed is used a proxy for atmospheric stability, the model is likely to preform poorly during highly stable atmospheric conditions. Although such stable conditions are rare in urban environments, this is a limitation of our modelling approach. Further to this, 
the \glssymbol{DeltaS} (hence the heat transfer between the urban canopy  atmosphere, as the residual) is parametrized according to \glssymbol{Rn} and the building parameters. This means that the dependency on the other atmospheric conditions, such as air temperature, wind speed, and humidity, is neglected in \glssymbol{Toolkit2}. However, given that the OHM  (used to calculate \glssymbol{DeltaS}) was developed based on observational data collected during summertime clear sky conditions, we are confident that \glssymbol{Toolkit2} will provide reasonable results during summer. Ongoing testing is needed to ascertain the limitations of the use of the OHM in \glssymbol{Toolkit2}. 

A resistance formulation  is used to calculate the \glssymbol{H} over water bodies (eq. \ref{eq:hwtr}), whereas \glssymbol{H} for the non-water surfaces is calculated as a residual (and not temperature and wind-speed dependent). Although testing has not revealed any  unexpected behavior, these different model formulations may  lead to artificial non-physical discrepancies. Ongoing testing and improvement of the water body model is needed. Ideally, its formulation would more closely resemble the non-water surfaces. 

\section{Conclusions and future work}\label{sec:conclusion}

This paper has presented \glssymbol{Toolkit2}; a simple and user-friendly urban microclimate model that is designed to be accessible to urban planners and policy makers. The model contains a number of key limitations that are outlined above. However, despite these caveats, rigorous testing suggests \glssymbol{Toolkit2} shows excellent potential for modelling the cooling effects of GBI projects. We believe this novel model is well balanced between  complexity and accuracy. The computational efficiency of the model and the reduced amount of input data required ensures that non-skilled users could use the model to ascertain reliable urban cooling estimates. Ongoing work will be done to improve \glssymbol{Toolkit2}, including the creation of GUI, the addition of human thermal comfort indices, and the improvements to model physics outlined above.

\subsection{Meteorological conditions during validation periods}

As outlined in Section \ref{sec:validation} we conducted model validation experiments during two different periods. A summary of the meteorological conditions for  land cover [Melbourne] (Figure \ref{fig:met}) and suburb scale [Mawson Lakes] (Figure \ref{fig:met3}) simulations are provided below.

\subsection{Tree surface temperature}\label{app:tree_surf}  

To assess $T_{tree}$ we obtained observational data from a tree experiment conducted in Melbourne, which including \glssymbol{Tsf} observations of the tree canopy (collected during February 2014). We also obtained a BoM meteorological forcing data for the 2014 case study period.  This period (not shown) was very similar to the February 2012 period (Figure \ref{fig:met}) used above. The tree data confirms that \glssymbol{Ta} is excellent predictor or $T_{tree}$.
